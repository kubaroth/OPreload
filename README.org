A custom HDK operator example with an option to reload changes at runtime, to retain the state of the loaded scene.

** Build:
Update CMake to point to Houdini installation directory ($HFS).
The `make install` copies the host shared library to the dso folder inside $HOME/houdini18.0. The guest plugin is currently not copied. (see notes below)
#+BEGIN_SRC 
mkdir __build
cd __build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/houdini18.0/dso
make install
#+END_SRC

** NOTES:
Houdini OP_OperatorTable - does not handle reloading .so files. Once path is loaded there is not easy way (that I know of) to dealocate it. A dumb workaround is to on every build increase the dso file name and tell Houdini to load the latest .so (which contains same symbols). This should do the trick to update operator in the current session.
